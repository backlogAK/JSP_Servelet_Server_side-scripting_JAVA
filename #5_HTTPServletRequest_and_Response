=================================================== Theoretical ===============================================

--> Request Disaptcher (Rd) --> Rd is used to connect two Servlet Ex: When from client side a request is made then if we have two servlets, one is website and other is 
                                                                          payment gateway then this Rd is used.
									  
					--> But when we want to redirect to payment gateway then Sendredirect() method is used. In this the page will say you are being 
					     redirected.
					--> In redirect two different request object is used.
